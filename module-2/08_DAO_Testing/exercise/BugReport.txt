Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1L) should have an ArrayList size of 2 (2 timesheets associated with employee ID: 1L)
Actual output:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1L) has a size of 1
How did you fix this bug?
    Changed: if (results.next()) to while(results.next()) on line 40 of JdbcTimesheetDao.java

    Changed: String sql on line 52 from employee_ID to project_ID

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved
Expected output:
    updatedTimesheet should match retrievedTimesheet
Actual output:

How did you fix this bug?
    Changed: String sql and jdbc.update() to include billable as a variable to be updated

Bug 4

Test that demonstrates problem:
    public void getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

How did you fix this bug?
    Changed: String sql on line 93 in JdbcTimesheetDao to include billable = true in the WHERE statement
